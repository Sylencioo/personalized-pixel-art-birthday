# Project Context: Personalized Pixel-Art Birthday Web App

This is a small, emotionally-driven React web application built as a 
single-link birthday experience for one specific person.

IMPORTANT PRINCIPLES:
- This is NOT a public generator or SaaS.
- No user accounts, no forms, no randomness.
- Personalization comes from a configuration file, not user input.
- The app should feel like a digital birthday card / experience.

TECH STACK:
- React (JavaScript)
- Vite
- Minimal CSS (no heavy frameworks)
- Pixel-art style visuals
- Optional background music
- AWS deployment (S3 + CloudFront)

ARCHITECTURE RULES:
- Personal data must live in src/config/birthdayConfig.js
- UI logic must be in reusable components
- Components should be small and focused
- No over-engineering

DESIGN GOALS:
- Soft, warm, emotional tone
- Pixel-art animations (symbolic, not literal)
- Smooth transitions
- Mobile-friendly

AI ASSISTANCE GUIDELINES:
- Prefer clarity over cleverness
- Avoid unnecessary abstractions
- Explain logic in comments when useful
- Keep code readable for a junior developer

TIMELINE:
- Target completion: 5 January
- Scope must remain small and achievable
